# Ohla-landing-page
First webpage developed for my business I had in Taiwan as practice

This project was to put what I've learned in The Odin Project so far to use.
Using HTML and CSS I made a simple landing page for the cloud kitchen restaurant I had in Taiwan.
On this landing page I used/implemented the following items:
1. flexbox
2. inserting images
3. creating links/buttons
4. using fonts linked from the internet (google fonts)
5. italics/bold in different texts
6. shadows
7. hovering effects
